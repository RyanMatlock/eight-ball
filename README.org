# README for eight-ball
* Purpose
Sometimes you just want to ask the universe big yes or no questions like, "Am I
a good person?" or, "Should I get a burrito for lunch?" The Magic 8-Ball is
here to help with that!

* Usage
=M-x eight-ball= will prompt you to ask a question, and it will respond with a
random answer. Passing the universal argument to =eight-ball= (typically done by
invoking it with =C-u M-x eight-ball=) will copy a timestamp, the question, and
response to the =kill-ring=.

See Customization section for whether to print the question along with response
in the minibuffer, whether or not to include the timestamp, what format the
timestamp should take, and the responses with which the Magic 8-Ball can reply.

* Installation
** From GitHub
Assuming this repo has been cloned to =/path/to/eight-ball=, add the following to
your init file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/eight-ball")
(require 'eight-ball)
#+END_SRC
(Evaluate that code, and you're ready to go without having to restart Emacs.)

** TODO MELPA (?)
(if/when added to MELPA):
#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x package-install RET eight-ball RET
#+END_SRC

* Customization
=eight-ball.el= provides the customization group =8ball=, which is available
through the =customize= interface under =Applications/Games/8ball=.
