* Purpose
Sometimes you just want to ask the universe (through a pseudo-random number
generator) big (yes or no) questions like, "Am I a good person?" or, "Should I
get a burrito for lunch?" The Magic 8-Ball is here to help with that!

* Usage
=M-x eight-ball= will prompt you to ask a question, and it will respond with
answer. Passing the universal argument to =eight-ball= (typically done by
invoking it with =C-u M-x eight-ball=) will copy a timestamp, the question, and
response to the =kill-ring=.

See [[*Customization][Customization]] for whether to print the question along with response in the
minibuffer, whether or not to include the timestamp, what format the timestamp
should take, and the responses with which the Magic 8-Ball can reply.

* Installation
** From =git=
Assuming this repo has been cloned to =/path/to/eight-ball=, add the following to
your init file:
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/eight-ball")
#+END_SRC

[TODO: Determine if ~;;;###autoload~ magic above ~(defun eight-ball ...)~ removes
the need to also include ~(require 'eight-ball)~.]

** TODO MELPA (?)
(if/when added to MELPA):
#+BEGIN_SRC
M-x package-install RET eight-ball RET
#+END_SRC

* Customization
To customize the behavior of =eight-ball=, use =M-x customize= \to =Applications= \to
=Games= \to =8ball=.
